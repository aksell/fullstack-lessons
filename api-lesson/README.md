In this lab you'll work on the Udacity bookshelf practice application to build a Flask API that responds to GET, PATCH, POST and DELETE requests, handles pagination and request arguments.

You'll primarily be working in __init__.py in the /backend/flaskr folder, where you'll find detailed instructions marked @TODO as well as suggestions for how to TEST the application after writing each route.

To start the application, use the buttons below to start the frontend application in one terminal window.


export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development


Start by running setup.sh then go to the backend directory and run `flask run`
